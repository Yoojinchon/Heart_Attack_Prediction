# Heart_Attack_Prediction
A machine learning project aimed at predicting the risk of heart attacks based on patient health data. This project leverages statistical analysis and predictive modeling to identify critical factors associated with heart attack risks, providing insights that could be valuable for early diagnosis and preventive healthcare.


Key Features:

- Objective: To develop a predictive model that estimates the likelihood of heart attacks based on various health indicators and demographic data.
- Technologies Used: Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.
- Machine Learning Techniques: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and Hyperparameter Tuning.
- Statistical Analysis: T-tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, Chi-Square tests to determine the significance of features.
- Performance Metrics: Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC curve to validate the modelâ€™s effectiveness.

Purpose:
This project aims to support healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk patients by highlighting the most impactful factors contributing to heart attacks. By providing actionable insights, this tool can be used to improve patient outcomes through timely intervention.
